# cupycrack
A tool for cracking hashes!

This tool is written in python, it's one of the first tools i've ever made (so don't expect perfection-)

you can use 'cracker.py --help' or '-h' to check the different options available for algorithms, cracking methods and how to specify a target hash!
I'm slowly going to add more hash algorithms as i think of them, starting with the most common ones.
